# Java-Database-Application-Postgresql-

A simple GUI application in order to save Factory data

-An OrderItem cannot be added to the database by entering orderid

-Also an Order must be belong to a Customer. So, user must enter a customerid while creating an Order

-The same logic is valid for product. A product must a Supplier's product


Besides that , I am aware of that my application is not quite efficient in terms of refactoring and postgres side. Also, GUI is not user friendly. However, operations work precisely.
